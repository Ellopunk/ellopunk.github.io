<h2>Creating a Stronger Community by Poisoning Your Own Well.</h2>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The technology industry has been rapidly growing for some time and as the industry grew

t/here has become a shift in our mind set as we could no longer fill all the roles that were

needed. With this came a push to diversify, to bring in new blood and new ideas and in the

process of doing so we began to develop a community.

Recently the topic of conversation has turned to Imposter syndrome, a feeling of inadequacy

that persist despite proof of the contrary, and the solution is being placed on the shoulders of

the individual alone. However we are not addressing the whole issue, or even acknowledging

that these feelings may be caused by a toxic part of our culture that leads us to break down

those we claim to want to build up.

What can I expect to learn?

     There has been a push in our community to be active mentors. What is not explained, however, is how to foster a healthy and prosperous relationship that benefits both the mentor and the mentee. Together we will explore the different types of mentoring relationships, as well as setting goals, tracking progress, and getting the most out of these relationships. 

We will explore the types of mentoring relationships that exist. We will also learn how to set goals, track progress towards those goals and how to get the most out of a mentorship.
